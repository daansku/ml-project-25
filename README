Classifying Brain Tumor MRI ScansA machine learning project comparing Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify brain tumors from MRI scans.📝 Project OverviewGlobal healthcare challenges, such as aging populations and rising chronic illness rates, necessitate more efficient diagnostic practices. This project automates the detection of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. By formulating the diagnosis as a supervised machine learning problem, we classify MRI scans into four distinct categories:GliomaMeningiomaPituitaryNo Tumor📂 DatasetThe data is sourced from the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle (Nickparvar M., 2021).Total Images: 7,023Original Split: 5,712 Training / 1,311 Testing.Our Split: We allocated 20% of the training set for validation.Training: 4,569 images (65%)Validation: 1,143 images (16%)Testing: 1,311 images (19%)🛠 MethodologyPreprocessingRaw images undergo several processing steps to ensure data quality (utilizing code by M. Nickparvar):Grayscale Conversion: Converting RGB to single-channel.Noise Removal: Applying Gaussian blur, thresholding, erosion, and dilation to isolate tumor features.Resizing: All images are resized to 64x64 pixels.Vectorization: * For Logistic Regression: Flattened to 1D vectors (4,096 features).For CNN: Kept as 2D arrays ($64 \times 64$).Models Implemented1. Multinomial Logistic Regression (Baseline)Objective: Classify based on linear combinations of pixel intensities.Loss Function: Logistic Loss.Iterations: 1,000.Pros: Simple, efficient in high-dimensional space.Cons: Cannot capture complex spatial patterns; assumes linearity.2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)Objective: Learn spatial hierarchies and complex patterns for image recognition.Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE).Optimizer: Adam.Epochs: 30.Architecture (16 Layers):6 Convolutional layers (filters: $32 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 128$).3 Max Pooling layers (to halve spatial dimensions).4 Dropout layers (20% rate to prevent overfitting).2 Dense layers.1 Flatten layer.📊 ResultsWe evaluated both models based on Accuracy, Loss, and Recall. Given the medical context, Recall is a critical metric (minimizing False Negatives).$$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$Quantitative ComparisonMetricLogistic RegressionCNNTraining Accuracy97.4%98.1%Validation Accuracy87.1%97.1%Test Accuracy88.6%97.4%Recall (TP Rate)98.1%99.5%False Negative Rate1.9%0.5%AnalysisLogistic Regression: Showed signs of overfitting (high training accuracy, lower validation accuracy). It struggled to distinguish between similar tumor types (e.g., Meningioma vs. Glioma).CNN: Achieved superior performance across all metrics. The False Negative rate was significantly lower (0.5%), classifying a tumor as "non-tumor" only once per 200 guesses.🏁 ConclusionWhile Logistic Regression serves as a decent baseline, the CNN model is the clear choice for this medical application. It effectively learns non-linear spatial patterns, resulting in higher accuracy and, most importantly, a safer diagnostic tool with a minimal false negative rate.Future improvements could include using higher-resolution images and implementing Cross-Validation to ensure robust performance independent of data splits.🔗 References & CreditsDataset: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset by Masoud Nickparvar (Kaggle)Preprocessing Code: M.
